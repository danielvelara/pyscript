> Run Python in Your HTML

(PyScript)(https://pyscript.net/) is a framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTML's interface and the power of [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) , [WASM](https://webassembly.org/), and modern web technologies. The PyScript framework provides users at every experience level with access to an expressive, easy-to-learn programming language with countless applications.

- What is PyScript? Well, here are some of the core components:

  - Python in the browser: Enable drop-in content, external file hosting, and application hosting without the reliance on server-side configuration
  - Python ecosystem: Run many popular packages of Python and the scientific stack (such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and more)
  - Python with JavaScript: Bi-directional communication between Python and Javascript objects and namespaces
  - Environment management: Allow users to define what packages and files to include for the page code to run
  - Visual application development: Use readily available curated UI components, such as buttons, containers, text boxes, and more
  - Flexible framework: A flexible framework that can be leveraged to create and share new pluggable and extensible components directly in Python

- _i.e. PyScript is just HTML, only more powerful, thanks to the rich and accessible ecosystem of Python libraries._

- To run we can import the WASM Python compiler and start using `<py-script>` to embed python in the browser

    Hello world! <br />
    This is the current date and time, as computed by Python:
    <py-script>
      from datetime import datetime now = datetime.now() now.strftime("%m/%d/%Y,
      %H:%M:%S")
    </py-script>
